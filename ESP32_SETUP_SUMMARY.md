# ESP32 Setup - Summary of Changes

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. ESP32Setup Component (Dashboard)
**Problem**: Device data was not being saved or persisted between sessions.

**Solution**: 
- Added `localStorage` integration to save devices
- Devices are now automatically loaded on component mount
- Changes are automatically saved whenever devices are added/removed
- Default devices (Downstairs & Upstairs) are provided if no saved data exists

**Files Modified**:
- `dashboard/src/pages/ESP32Setup.tsx`

### 2. MQTT Integration Updates
**Changes**:
- Updated light zones from `zone1/zone2/zone3` to `downstairs/upstairs`
- Aligned with ESP32 relay naming convention
- Updated `LightsControl.tsx` to show proper zone names

**Files Modified**:
- `dashboard/src/contexts/MqttContext.tsx`
- `dashboard/src/components/dashboard/LightsControl.tsx`

## üìÅ New Files Created

   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **QUICKSTART.md**
   - Fast setup guide for beginners
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Common issues and solutions

4. **platformio.ini**
   - PlatformIO configuration (alternative to Arduino IDE)
   - Pre-configured with required libraries

### System Documentation
5. **ARCHITECTURE.md** (Root folder)
   - System architecture overview
   - Data flow diagrams
   - Network configuration
   - Security considerations
   - Scalability guidelines

## üîß How to Use

### Dashboard Setup
1. Navigate to ESP32 Setup page in dashboard
2. Add your ESP32 devices with:
   - Device name (e.g., "Downstairs Controller")
   - MQTT topic (e.g., "mosque/lights/downstairs")
   - IP address (e.g., "192.168.1.101")
3. Devices are automatically saved to browser storage
4. View device status (Online/Offline)
5. Remove or reconnect devices as needed

### ESP32 Hardware Setup
1. Connect relays to ESP32:
   - Relay 1 ‚Üí GPIO 4 (Downstairs)
   - Relay 2 ‚Üí GPIO 5 (Upstairs)
   - GND ‚Üí GND
   - VCC ‚Üí 5V

2. Install Arduino IDE and required libraries:
   - ESP32 board support
   - PubSubClient library

3. Configure the code:
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_SSID";
   const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD";
   const char* mqtt_server = "YOUR_MQTT_BROKER_IP";
   ```

4. Upload to ESP32

5. Monitor via Serial Monitor (115200 baud)

### Testing
From the dashboard:
1. Go to Lights Control section
2. Toggle "Downstairs Lights" or "Upstairs Lights"
3. ESP32 should respond and switch relays
4. Status updates appear in real-time

## üéØ Key Features

### Persistence
- ‚úÖ Device configurations saved in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Survives browser refresh/restart
- ‚úÖ Per-browser storage (use export/import for sharing)

### Real-time Communication
- ‚úÖ MQTT for instant updates
- ‚úÖ Bidirectional communication
- ‚úÖ Status reporting from ESP32
- ‚úÖ Command sending from dashboard

### Reliability
- ‚úÖ Auto-reconnect on WiFi loss
- ‚úÖ Auto-reconnect on MQTT disconnect
- ‚úÖ Heartbeat/status messages every 30s
- ‚úÖ LED indicator for connection status

### Scalability
- ‚úÖ Easy to add more devices
- ‚úÖ Simple topic structure
- ‚úÖ Modular code design
- ‚úÖ Support for future sensors/actuators

## üìä System Requirements

### Hardware
- ESP32 Development Board
- 2-Channel Relay Module
- Power supply for relays
- WiFi network (2.4GHz)

### Software
- Arduino IDE 1.8+ or PlatformIO
- Mosquitto MQTT Broker
- Modern web browser for dashboard
- Node.js 18+ (for dashboard development)

### Network
- Local WiFi network
- Computer on same network as ESP32
- Open ports: 1883 (MQTT), 8080 (MQTT WS), 5001 (Prayer API)

## üîê Security Notes

**Current Setup** (Development):
- No authentication required
- Local network only
- Suitable for testing and development

**Production Recommendations**:
- Enable MQTT username/password
- Use TLS/SSL encryption
- Implement firewall rules
- Regular firmware updates
- Network segmentation (IoT VLAN)

## üìû Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the README.md for detailed troubleshooting
2. Review QUICKSTART.md for common setup problems
3. Verify ARCHITECTURE.md for system understanding
4. Check Serial Monitor output for ESP32 debug info
5. Test MQTT broker connectivity independently

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Configure and upload ESP32 code
2. Test basic on/off functionality
3. Verify status updates in dashboard

### Future Enhancements:
- Add more ESP32 devices for additional zones
- Implement scheduling/timers
- Add energy monitoring
- Integrate with prayer times for auto-control
- Mobile app support
- Cloud backup of configurations

## üìù Notes

- All configurations are stored locally in browser
- Each ESP32 needs a unique device_id
- MQTT topics should match between ESP32 code and dashboard
- Keep ESP32 firmware updated for security
- Test thoroughly before deploying to production
